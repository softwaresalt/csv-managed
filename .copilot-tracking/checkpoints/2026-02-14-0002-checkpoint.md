## Session Summary

Completed Phase 7 of the 001-baseline-sdd-spec feature using the build-feature skill. Phase 7 validates User Story 5 (Summary Statistics & Frequency Analysis) covering FR-045 through FR-047. All 3 validation audits (T084-T086) confirmed existing code fully implements the spec. Existing tests covered 4 of 5 acceptance scenarios; 2 new integration tests were added for decimal/currency precision (acceptance scenario 5). All 188 tests pass, clippy and fmt clean, committed as `cfe9d88`.

## Files Modified

| File | Change |
| ---- | ------ |
| tests/stats.rs | Added `stats_preserves_currency_precision_in_output` and `stats_preserves_decimal_precision_in_output` integration tests |
| specs/001-baseline-sdd-spec/tasks.md | Marked all 9 Phase 7 tasks (T084-T092) as `[x]` complete |
| .copilot-tracking/memory/2026-02-13/001-baseline-sdd-spec-phase-7-memory.md | Created session memory for phase 7 |

## Key Decisions

1. No architectural decisions made — all code already existed and passed audit. No ADRs created for this phase.
2. The `stats` command automatically applies schema transformations without `--apply-mappings` flag (unlike `process`), which is correct by design since stats always needs typed values.

## Failed Approaches

No failed approaches.

## Open Questions

No open questions.

## Next Steps

Continue with Phase 8 (User Story 6 — Multi-File Append, FR-048 through FR-050) or Phase 9 (User Story 7 — Streaming Pipeline Support, FR-053). Both are P2 priority and can proceed independently. Remaining phases in tasks.md:

- Phase 8: T093-T099 (append)
- Phase 9: T100-T106 (streaming pipeline)
- Phase 10: T107-T117 (expression engine)
- Phase 11: T118-T120, T154 (schema columns)
- Phase 12: T121-T124 (self-install)
- Phase 13: T125-T156 (polish and cross-cutting)
